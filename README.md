Antibiotic resistance is becoming a bigger problem worldwide. 
With this knowledge a study was performed about the resistome in stool samples of hospitalised patients. 
With the following flowchart, this study was realised. 

This pipeline is build into two pathways; the assembly-based analysis and the read-based analysis.
